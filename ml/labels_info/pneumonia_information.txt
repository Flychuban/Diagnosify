Pneumonia Prediction Using Chest X-Ray Images
Our system provides an advanced tool for predicting pneumonia using chest X-ray images. Powered by cutting-edge machine learning algorithms, this feature is designed to assist medical professionals in diagnosing pneumonia more effectively. Below is a detailed guide to ensure proper use of the system:

- Preparing the Chest X-Ray Image
To achieve accurate predictions, ensure the following:

Image Quality:
The X-ray image should be clear, high-resolution, and devoid of artifacts (e.g., blurring, noise, or overexposure).

Image Format:
Accepted file formats include JPEG, PNG. Ensure the file size does not exceed the upload limit specified on the platform.

Standard Views:
The X-ray image should ideally be taken in the posteroanterior (PA) or anteroposterior (AP) view. Other views may reduce prediction accuracy.

Proper Positioning:
Ensure the patient’s positioning adheres to standard radiological practices to avoid distortions in the X-ray.

Clinical Interpretation
The prediction tool is designed to assist, not replace, clinical judgment. Always correlate the results with the patient’s clinical presentation, history, and other diagnostic findings.
If the prediction conflicts with clinical observations, consider additional diagnostic measures and radiological reviews.
