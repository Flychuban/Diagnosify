Cancer Area Segmentation in Microscopic Cell Images
Our cancer segmentation tool is designed to assist medical professionals and researchers by identifying and segmenting cancerous regions in microscopic cell images. Using advanced deep learning algorithms, the system highlights cancer-affected areas, enabling precise analysis and aiding in diagnostic and treatment planning. Below is a guide to understanding and utilizing this feature effectively:

- About the Tool
This model leverages state-of-the-art image segmentation techniques to differentiate between cancerous and non-cancerous regions within a given microscopic image. It provides a detailed visualization of affected areas, facilitating deeper insights into the extent and pattern of cellular abnormalities.

- Preparing the Microscopic Image
To ensure accurate segmentation, follow these guidelines:

Image Source:
The image should be a microscopic slide prepared using standard histopathological techniques.
Image Quality:
Ensure high resolution, clear focus, and proper lighting to capture all relevant cellular details. Avoid overexposure or shadows.
Image Format:
Accepted formats include JPEG, PNG.
Magnification Level:
Images captured under recommended magnifications (e.g., 40x or 100x) yield the best results.

- Uploading the Image
Navigate to the Cancer Area Segmentation Tool on the website.
Click "Upload Image" and select the prepared microscopic image.
Verify that the image meets the quality requirements before uploading.

- Understanding the Results
Once the image is processed, the system provides:

Segmentation Map:
A visual overlay highlighting cancerous regions within the image.

Cancer Marker Identification:
Insights into specific patterns or features associated with cancer within the segmented areas.
- Clinical Applications
This tool is designed to complement, not replace, clinical expertise.
