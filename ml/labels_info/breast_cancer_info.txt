radius_mean: Mean of distances from the center to points on the perimeter of the tumor.
perimeter_mean: Perimeter of the tumor, which is the total length of the boundary.
area_mean: Area of the tumor, calculated using mathematical formulas.
compactness_mean: Measure of how compact the tumor is, calculated as perimeter^2 / (4 * pi * area).

concave points_mean: Number of concave portions of the tumor.
radius_se: Standard error of the mean of distances from the center to points on the perimeter.
perimeter_se: Standard error of the perimeter.
area_se: Standard error of the area.
radius_worst: Worst (largest) value of the mean of distances from the center to points on the perimeter.
perimeter_worst: Worst value of the perimeter.
area_worst: Worst value of the area.
compactness_worst: Worst value of compactness.
concavity_worst: Worst value of concavity.
concave points_worst: Worst value of the number of concave portions.
