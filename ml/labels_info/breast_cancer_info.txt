Radius Mean: This is the average distance from the center of the nucleus to its perimeter. 
Larger mean radius values may indicate tumors that are more likely to be malignant due to their size and growth behavior.


Perimeter Mean: This measures the average length of the outline of the nucleus. Similar to radius, a larger perimeter could suggest a more aggressive or advanced tumor.


Area Mean: The average area covered by the nucleus. Larger nuclei areas are often associated with malignant tumors, reflecting rapid growth and potential aggressiveness of the cancer.


Compactness Mean: This is calculated as the perimeter squared divided by the area. It provides a measure of how compact the shape of the nucleus is. 
Higher compactness may indicate malignancy, as cancer cells often have irregular and compact shapes.


Concavity Mean: The average concavity in the contour of the nucleus. Tumors with higher concavity values may have more irregular shapes, which is a characteristic often associated with malignancy.


Concave Points Mean: This is the average number of concave portions of the contour of the nucleus. Nuclei with more concave points are generally more irregular and can indicate a higher likelihood of breast cancer.


Radius SE: The standard error of the radius measurements. A higher standard error could suggest variability in the tumor size, potentially indicating malignancy.


Perimeter SE: The standard error for the perimeter measurements. Like radius SE, a higher value may reflect irregularity and heterogeneity in tumor shape, often seen in malignant tumors.


Area SE: The standard error of the area measurements. Variability in the area can be an indicator of aggressive growth patterns typical of malignant tumors.


Radius Worst: The largest mean radius value recorded. Larger maximum radius values are strongly indicative of malignancy, reflecting the aggressive expansion of cancerous tumors.


Perimeter Worst: The largest perimeter measurement observed. This indicates the potential aggressiveness of the tumor; larger perimeters are often seen in malignant cases.


Area Worst: The largest area of the nucleus among the samples. A larger maximum area is a critical indicator of malignancy due to rapid tumor growth.


Compactness Worst: The worst case (highest) of the compactness measurements. Higher values indicate a denser, more irregular tumor, which is a common characteristic of malignant breast cancer.


Concavity Worst: The highest concavity observed. Significant concavity suggests a highly irregular and potentially aggressive tumor, which is characteristic of malignant breast cancer.


Concave Points Worst: The maximum number of concave points measured. An increased number of concave points in the worst case suggests a high level of tumor irregularity and is associated with a higher likelihood of breast cancer.
