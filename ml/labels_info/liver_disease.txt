Age: Age can be a significant factor in liver disease, as the risk of developing conditions such as cirrhosis, liver cancer, and other liver-related problems can increase with age. 
This is due to the cumulative effect of liver injury over time from various causes such as alcohol use, obesity, and viral hepatitis.


Gender: Gender can influence the risk profile for liver diseases. For instance, men may have a higher risk of liver disease related to alcohol consumption, 
while women might be more susceptible to autoimmune liver diseases. Hormonal differences can also affect disease progression and outcomes.


Total Bilirubin: Bilirubin is a yellow pigment formed by the breakdown of red blood cells. Elevated levels of total bilirubin can indicate liver dysfunction, 
as the liver is responsible for bilirubin's processing and excretion. High bilirubin levels can lead to jaundice, which is a common symptom of liver disease.


Direct Bilirubin: Direct bilirubin is a portion of total bilirubin that is processed by the liver and directly excreted into the bile. 
Elevated levels can suggest liver damage or bile duct obstruction, providing insight into the nature and location of liver dysfunction.


Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP): ALP is an enzyme found in various tissues, with high concentrations in the liver, bile ducts, and bones. 
High levels of ALP can indicate liver damage or diseases related to the bile ducts, such as blockages or inflammation.


Alamine Aminotransferase (ALT): ALT is an enzyme primarily found in the liver. It plays a role in converting proteins into energy for liver cells. 
Elevated ALT levels are a sensitive indicator of liver cell injury, often seen in conditions like hepatitis.


Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST): AST is an enzyme found in the liver and other organs. High levels of AST can indicate liver damage but are less specific to the liver than ALT. 
AST to ALT ratio can also provide insights into the causes of liver injury.


Total Proteins: This measure includes all the proteins in the blood, including albumin and globulin. Abnormal levels can indicate liver disease, as the liver is crucial for protein synthesis. 
Low levels may suggest liver dysfunction or damage.


Albumin: Albumin is the most abundant protein made by the liver, and it plays a critical role in maintaining blood volume and pressure. 
Low albumin levels can indicate chronic liver disease, as it suggests the liver's synthetic function is impaired.


Albumin/Globulin (AG) Ratio: This ratio compares levels of albumin to globulin, another type of protein. An abnormal AG ratio can indicate liver disease, kidney disease, or other conditions. 
It is particularly useful in assessing liver function and nutritional status.
