MDVP:Jitter(%): Measures the variation in the frequency or pitch of the voice signal, expressed as a percentage. 
Higher values may indicate greater vocal instability, which is common in Parkinson's disease due to impaired vocal cord control.


MDVP:Jitter(Abs): The absolute difference in consecutive periods of the vocal frequency, indicating pitch variation. 
Smaller values are typical in healthy speech, while larger values suggest more pronounced vocal tremor or instability.


MDVP:RAP: The Relative Amplitude Perturbation measures the variation in the amplitude of the voice. 
It reflects how much the amplitude varies in a short time, with higher values indicating more variability and potential vocal cord dysfunction.


MDVP:PPQ: The Pitch Period Perturbation Quotient is another measure of the variability in pitch, but calculated over a longer timeframe than RAP. 
Increased values can signify more pronounced speech irregularities associated with Parkinson's disease.


Jitter:DDP: A measure of cycle-to-cycle variability in vocal fold vibration, indicating irregularities in the voice signal. 
DDP stands for Difference of Differences of Periods, highlighting more detailed aspects of jitter over time.


MDVP:Shimmer: Reflects the variation in loudness or amplitude of the voice signal. Higher levels of shimmer suggest greater amplitude variability, which can be a sign of vocal fold dysfunction.


MDVP:Shimmer(dB): The decibel difference in the amplitude variation, providing an intensity perspective to shimmer. 
Increases in this measure can indicate a loss of control over voice amplitude, seen in Parkinson’s disease.


Shimmer:APQ3: Amplitude Perturbation Quotient for 3 cycles, measuring the variability in amplitude across three vocal cycles. 
It helps quantify the dynamic changes in voice amplitude, where higher values denote more variability.


Shimmer:APQ5: Similar to APQ3, but measures amplitude variability over five cycles. 
Both APQ3 and APQ5 offer insights into the consistency of vocal amplitude, important for detecting speech abnormalities.


MDVP:APQ: The overall Amplitude Perturbation Quotient, representing general amplitude variability in the voice. A broader measure compared to APQ3 and APQ5, indicating global amplitude fluctuations.


Shimmer:DDA: Another measure of amplitude variability, calculated similarly to APQ3 but over different cycles. It reinforces the assessment of vocal instability and amplitude variation.


NHR (Noise to Harmonics Ratio): Indicates the ratio of noise in the voice signal to the harmonics. Higher NHR values can signify a more raspy and breathy voice, often associated with Parkinson’s disease.


HNR (Harmonics to Noise Ratio): The inverse of NHR, showing the ratio of harmonic components to noise components in the voice. Lower HNR values are typical in disordered speech, including that affected by Parkinson's disease.


RPDE (Recurrence Period Density Entropy): A measure of the dynamic complexity of the voice signal, capturing the recurrence behavior of the signal over time. Abnormalities in RPDE may indicate neurological impairments affecting speech.


DFA (Detrended Fluctuation Analysis): Analyzes the signal for self-similarity or fractal patterns. Changes in DFA values can reflect alterations in speech production control, potentially due to Parkinson’s disease.


PPE (Pitch Period Entropy): Quantifies the variability in the pitch period, providing insight into the regularity and complexity of the vocal signal. 
Higher PPE values can indicate more erratic speech patterns characteristic of Parkinson's disease.
