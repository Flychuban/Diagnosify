Age: Age is a significant risk factor for heart disease, with the risk increasing as individuals get older.

Gender: Gender (male or female) can influence the risk profile for heart disease. Men tend to have a higher risk of heart disease at a younger age, while women's risk increases after menopause.

Chest Pain (CP): The type of chest pain experienced by an individual can provide important information for heart disease diagnosis. Certain types of chest pain, such as angina, may indicate a higher likelihood of heart disease.

Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps): High blood pressure (hypertension) is a major risk factor for heart disease. Monitoring resting blood pressure levels is crucial in assessing the risk of developing heart disease.

Cholesterol Levels (chol): Elevated levels of LDL cholesterol (often referred to as "bad" cholesterol) and low levels of HDL cholesterol ("good" cholesterol) are associated with an increased risk of heart disease.

Fasting Blood Sugar (fbs): High fasting blood sugar levels can indicate the presence of diabetes, which is a risk factor for heart disease.

Resting Electrocardiographic Results (restecg): The resting electrocardiogram (ECG) results can provide insights into the electrical activity of the heart and help identify abnormalities that may be indicative of heart disease.

Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (thalach): The maximum heart rate achieved during exercise can provide valuable information about cardiovascular fitness and potential heart disease risks.

Exercise-Induced Angina (exang): The presence of angina (chest pain) during exercise can indicate underlying heart disease.

ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest (oldpeak): The amount of ST segment depression observed on an ECG during exercise can indicate the presence of myocardial ischemia, which is a sign of impaired blood flow to the heart.

Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment (slope): The slope of the ST segment during exercise can provide additional information about the severity and progression of heart disease.

Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy (ca): The number of major blood vessels showing blockages or narrowing, as determined by fluoroscopy, can help assess the extent of coronary artery disease.

Thalassemia (thal): Thalassemia is an inherited blood disorder that can affect the oxygen-carrying capacity of red blood cells. Certain types of thalassemia may be associated with an increased risk of heart disease.
