How to Input Measurements for Accurate Body Fat Prediction
To ensure precise predictions of body fat percentage, it is essential to input accurate measurements into the system. Below is a detailed guide to each required parameter:

1. Body Density (D)
Definition:
Body density is determined by underwater weighing and measures how compact the body mass is.

Unit:
Grams per cubic centimeter (gm/cm³).

Note:
This value may require specialized equipment to measure and is often obtained through professional body composition analysis.

2. Age
Definition:
The individual's age in full years.

Unit:
Years (e.g., 25, 40, etc.).

Note:
Simply provide your current age as a whole number.

3. Weight
Definition:
The total body weight measured in pounds.

Unit:
Pounds (lbs).

Note:
Use a reliable scale for accuracy. Round to the nearest pound.

4. Height
Definition:
The individual’s height.

Unit:
Inches.

Note:
If height is in centimeters, convert it to inches by dividing by 2.54.

5. Circumference Measurements
These measurements are taken at specific body locations and are crucial for estimating body fat.

Neck Circumference

Definition: Measured around the neck, just below the Adam’s apple.
Unit: Centimeters (cm).
Chest Circumference

Definition: Measured around the fullest part of the chest.
Unit: Centimeters (cm).
Abdomen Circumference

Definition: Measured horizontally at the level of the umbilicus (belly button).
Unit: Centimeters (cm).
Hip Circumference

Definition: Measured around the widest part of the hips.
Unit: Centimeters (cm).
Thigh Circumference

Definition: Measured around the largest part of the thigh.
Unit: Centimeters (cm).
Knee Circumference

Definition: Measured around the middle of the kneecap.
Unit: Centimeters (cm).
Ankle Circumference

Definition: Measured just above the ankle bone.
Unit: Centimeters (cm).
Biceps Circumference

Definition: Measured around the biceps with the arm extended.
Unit: Centimeters (cm).
Forearm Circumference

Definition: Measured around the fullest part of the forearm.
Unit: Centimeters (cm).
Wrist Circumference

Definition: Measured around the wrist at its narrowest point.
Unit: Centimeters (cm).
Note for All Circumference Measurements:
Use a flexible measuring tape and ensure it is snug but not tight. Take measurements at the specified anatomical landmarks for accuracy.
