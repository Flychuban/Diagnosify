Pregnancies: The number of pregnancies a person has had can affect the risk of developing gestational diabetes during pregnancy and type 2 diabetes later in life. 
Women with a history of gestational diabetes are at a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

Glucose: Glucose levels, typically measured after fasting, are crucial for diagnosing diabetes. High fasting glucose levels can indicate impaired fasting glucose, prediabetes, or diabetes. 
Maintaining glucose levels within a normal range is essential for managing diabetes and reducing the risk of complications.


Blood Pressure (BP): High blood pressure, or hypertension, can exacerbate the risk of developing diabetes-related complications, 
such as cardiovascular disease and kidney damage. Monitoring and controlling BP is vital for people with diabetes.


Skin Thickness: The thickness of the skin at the triceps can be an indicator of insulin resistance when measured as part of a skinfold test. 
Higher measurements may be associated with greater insulin resistance, a condition that often precedes type 2 diabetes.


Insulin: The level of insulin, a hormone that regulates blood glucose, in the body can provide insight into how the body is managing glucose. 
Low levels of insulin or a resistance to insulin's effects are key characteristics of type 2 diabetes.


BMI (Body Mass Index): BMI is a measure of body fat based on height and weight. Overweight and obesity are significant risk factors for developing type 2 diabetes. 
Managing body weight can help prevent the onset of diabetes or manage the condition more effectively.
