Specific Gravity: A measure of the density of urine compared to water. It can indicate the kidney's ability to concentrate urine. 
Abnormal values may suggest kidney dysfunction, as healthy kidneys typically filter waste to concentrate urine without losing too much or too little water.


Albumin: A protein that can pass into the urine when the kidneys are damaged. Normally, the kidneys prevent large molecules like albumin from being lost. 
However, kidney damage can allow albumin to leak into the urine, a condition known as albuminuria, which is an early sign of kidney disease.


Serum Creatinine: A waste product from the normal breakdown of muscle tissue that the kidneys should filter out. 
High levels in the blood can indicate impaired kidney function, as they suggest the kidneys are not effectively removing creatinine from the bloodstream.


Hemoglobin: A protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. Low hemoglobin levels can be a sign of anemia, which is common in kidney disease. 
The kidneys produce erythropoietin, a hormone that stimulates red blood cell production, and damage can lead to decreased erythropoietin and anemia.


PCV (Packed Cell Volume): Measures the volume percentage of red blood cells in blood. A low PCV indicates anemia, while a high PCV could suggest dehydration. 
In the context of kidney disease, a low PCV can indicate erythropoietin deficiency due to kidney dysfunction.


Hypertension: High blood pressure is both a cause and a complication of chronic kidney disease. The kidneys help regulate blood pressure by controlling the volume of blood 
and the amount of blood vessel constriction. When the kidneys are damaged, they may not perform these functions properly, leading to increased blood pressure.
