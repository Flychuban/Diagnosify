# Service Usage Guide

This guide provides instructions on how to use the service provided by the [Service Name].

## Overview

The service acts as a proxy for routing requests to different backend services based on the requested URL. It retrieves the target URL from a configuration file and forwards the request along with the request body and headers to the specified backend service.

## Getting Started

To start using the service, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository containing the service code to your local machine.

3. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using npm.

   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   npm install
   ```

4. **Configuration**: Update the configuration file `config.json` with the appropriate mappings of service names to their corresponding redirect URLs.

5. **Start the Service**: Run the service using the following command:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The service will start listening for requests on the specified port.

## Example Usage

Assuming the service is running on `http://localhost:7000`, here's an example of how to send a request to the service:

```http
POST http://localhost:7000/ml/service1/endpoint
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "key": "value"
}
```

```microservices.json
{
    "ml":{
        "baseUrl":"http://localhost:5000"
        }
}
```

and this will result in the following http reroute

```http

http://localhost:7000/ml/service1/endpoint -> http://localhost:5000/ml/service1/endpoint

```
