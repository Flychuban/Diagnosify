MDVP stands for "Multidimensional Voice Program" and Fo represents the fundamental frequency of the voice.
MDVP:Fo(Hz) refers to the average vocal fundamental frequency in Hertz.
It represents the average pitch of the voice.

MDVP:Fhi(Hz) represents the maximum vocal fundamental frequency in Hertz.
It indicates the highest pitch achieved during vocalization.

MDVP:Flo(Hz) represents the minimum vocal fundamental frequency in Hertz.
It indicates the lowest pitch reached during vocalization.

MDVP:Jitter(%) measures the variation in vocal fold cycle length.
It quantifies the irregularity or jitteriness in the timing of vocal fold vibrations.

MDVP:Jitter(Abs) represents the absolute value of jitter.
It measures the average difference between consecutive periods of the fundamental frequency.

MDVP:RAP stands for Relative Average Perturbation.
It measures the variation in vocal fold cycle length within consecutive periods.

MDVP:PPQ stands for Five-point Period Perturbation Quotient.
It is a measure of the perturbation in the fundamental frequency, calculated based on five consecutive periods.

Jitter:DDP represents Jitter: Difference, Average Difference between consecutive periods.
It is calculated as the average absolute difference of differences between consecutive cycles of the fundamental frequency.

MDVP:Shimmer measures the variation in amplitude of the vocal fold vibrations.
It quantifies the irregularities in the magnitude or strength of the voice signal.

MDVP:Shimmer(dB) represents Shimmer measured in decibels.
It quantifies the variation in amplitude on a logarithmic scale.

Shimmer:APQ3 stands for Amplitude Perturbation Quotient (APQ3).
It calculates the average absolute difference between consecutive amplitude peaks within 3 consecutive periods.

Shimmer:APQ5 represents Amplitude Perturbation Quotient (APQ5).
It calculates the average absolute difference between consecutive amplitude peaks within 5 consecutive periods.

MDVP:APQ represents Amplitude Perturbation Quotient (APQ).
It calculates the average absolute difference between consecutive amplitude peaks within the entire phonation period.

Shimmer:DDA stands for Shimmer: Difference, Average Difference between consecutive periods.
It calculates the average absolute differences between consecutive amplitude peaks within the entire phonation period.

NHR stands for Noise-to-Harmonics Ratio.
It represents the ratio of noise to tonal components in the voice signal.

HNR stands for Harmonic-to-Noise Ratio.
It represents the ratio of tonal components to noise in the voice signal.
